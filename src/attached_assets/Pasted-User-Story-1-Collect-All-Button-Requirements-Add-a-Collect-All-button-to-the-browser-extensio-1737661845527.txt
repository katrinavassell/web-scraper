Ensure no individual clicks on posts are required.
Implementation:

UI Update:
Add a button labeled "Collect All" to the extension's interface.
Functionality:

Store the collected posts into the list/database.
Add a timestamp (timestampCollected) for each collected post.
User Story 2: Prevent Duplicates
Requirements:

Prevent duplicate posts from being added to the list.
A post is considered unique if its postLink postListItemBody is unique.

Check if the postLink postListItemBody of the new post already exists in the stored list.
If a duplicate is detected:
Skip adding the post to the list.
User Story 3: Update Existing Posts
Requirements:

If a post with the same URL is collected again:
Do not create a new record.
Compare the new data with the stored record to check for changes.
If there are changes:
Update a column called "Changes" with:
The name of the changed column(s).
Original value(s).
New value(s).
Timestamp of the update.
Implementation:

Detect Changes:
When collecting posts, check if the postLink postListItemBody already exists in the list.
If it exists:
Compare the postTitle, postDetails, and count fields with the existing record.
Log Changes:
For each changed field:
Add an entry to the Changes column in the format:
css
Copy
Edit
[  {    columnName: 'columnName',    originalValue: 'originalValue',    newValue: 'newValue',    timestamp: 'timestamp'  },  ...]
Update Existing Record:
Update the post record in the list with the new values.
Append the change log to the Changes column.
