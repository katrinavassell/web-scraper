User Story 1: "Collect All" Button
Requirements:
Add a "Collect All" button to the browser extension interface.
The button collects only posts currently visible in the viewport.
No individual clicks on posts are required.
Implementation:
UI Update:
Add a button labeled "Collect All" to the extension's popup interface.
Functionality:
Use JavaScript to iterate through all posts visible in the viewport.
Extract the following details from each post:
postTitle: Title of the post.
postDetails: Description or details of the post.
count: Number of votes on the post.
postLink postListItemBody: Unique URL or identifier for the post.
Add a timestamp (timestampCollected) for each collected post.
Store the collected posts in the list or database.
User Story 2: Prevent Duplicates
Requirements:
Prevent duplicate posts from being added to the list.
A post is unique if its postLink postListItemBody is unique.
Implementation:
Before adding a post to the list:
Check if the postLink postListItemBody already exists in the stored list.
If a duplicate is found:
Skip adding the post to the list.
User Story 3: Update Existing Posts
Requirements:
If a post with the same URL (postLink postListItemBody) is collected again:
Do not create a new record.
Compare the new data (postTitle, postDetails, count) with the stored record.
If changes are detected:
Update the Changes column with:
The name of the changed field(s).
Original value(s).
New value(s).
A timestamp of the update.
Implementation:
Detect Changes:

Check if the post already exists in the stored list.
If it does, compare the postTitle, postDetails, and count fields.
Log Changes:

For each changed field:
Add an entry to the Changes column in this format:
json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "columnName": "columnName",
    "originalValue": "originalValue",
    "newValue": "newValue",
    "timestamp": "timestamp"
  }
]
Update Existing Record:

Update the post's data with the new values.
Append the change log to the Changes column.
Database Structure:
Rows: Each row represents a collected post.
Columns:
postTitle: Title of the post.
postDetails: Details or description of the post.
count: Number of votes on the post.
postLink postListItemBody: Unique URL (primary key).
timestampCollected: The timestamp when the post was first collected.
Changes: An array that logs changes to the post.
Important Notes:
Visibility Limitation:

Only posts currently visible in the viewport will be added to the list.
This limitation ensures efficient and focused collection of posts without loading unnecessary data.
Duplicate Prevention:

Posts with the same "postLink postListItemBody" (unique url) will not be added twice.
Data Accuracy:

If an existing post is collected again and has updated data, it will be modified in place with a change log to track differences.
